This library provides the necessary Debezium drivers required for the CDC (Change Data Capture) connector in Ballerina. It enables listening to changes in MySQL databases seamlessly within Ballerina projects.

## Usage

To include the `mysql.cdc.driver` dependency in your project, simply import the module as shown below:

```ballerina
import ballerinax/cdc;
import ballerinax/mysql.cdc.driver as _;
```

The `mysql.cdc.driver` library is bundled with the required drivers, so no additional configuration is needed.
